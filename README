Made this cause I hate stuff beeping at me and prefer visual notification.
This also handles notify.pl not firing while you're actually focused on
the clients terminal window (hence the small modification).

notify.pl slightly modified so it receives for 'focus change' signals
and has a setting variable notify_enabled so it can be turned on/off
explicitly.

systemtray.pl currently has 2 options.
boolean - systemtray_update - default: on
		Actually process data levels and focus.
		Should really seperate them into seperate options.

boolean - systemtray_goto_status - default: on
		Go to the status page so all channels can highlight
		to provide correct data level inspection.
		The currently focused channel doesn't change
		data levels.

Bugs/Issues

This cannot track focus through screen, say you create in one window;
destroy it and reattach to screen in another. focus tracking won't work
as the window id is now invalid; use /focus_get_new_id to get the latest.
Maybe that can be automated?

Launching irssi in a terminal that doesn't have focus won't work. When launching
it thinks the currently active window has focus. again use /focus_get_new_id to
fix.

Probably some more I can't think off...
